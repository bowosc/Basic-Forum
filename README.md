# Basic Forum

Built with 100% Free-Range Flask Python! (and HTML and a bunch of python modules that don't use 100% flask or python. )

This is just a fun little project that I had a good time putting together. 


# Features:
- User account creation and sign-in, stored using an SQLAlchemy database.
- User post creation, with images, stored using an SQLAlchemy database.
- Feed page generation, editable posts-per-page variable. 
- User avatar/profile-pic uploading, verifying and compressing system.
- Password hashing, which -this time- actually works :)
- Search through posts
- Administrator user & moderating powers for specific accounts, including censoring and removing posts.


Plus more!
