# Basic Forum

Built with 100% Free-Range Flask Python! (and HTML and all the other Python and C and C++ and FORTRAN and whatever in the modules, but other than that, all Flask Python. )

This is just a fun little project that I had a good time putting together. (so, similar to everything on my account.)

Feel free to comment any feedback! 

# Features:
- User account creation and sign-in, stored using an SQLAlchemy database.
- User post creation, with images, stored using an SQLAlchemy database.
- Feed page generation, editable posts-per-page variable. 
- User avatar/profile-pic uploading, verifying and compressing system.
- Password hashing, which -this time- actually works :)
- Administrator user tag & moderating powers, including censoring and removing posts.

Plus more!
