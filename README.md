Built with Flask! Download & run on localhost to check it out. 
This is just a fun little project that I had a good time putting together. (so, similar to everything on my account.)
Feel free to comment any feedback! 

# Features:
- User account creation and sign-in, stored using an SQLAlchemy database.
- User post creation, with images, stored using an SQLAlchemy database.
- Feed page generation, editable posts-per-page variable. 
- User avatar/profile-pic uploading, verifying and compressing system.
- Password hashing, which -this time- actually works :)
- Administrator user tag & moderating powers, including censoring and removing posts.

Plus more!
  



If there's a Venv in here, just ignore it. I'm trying to remove it right now.
